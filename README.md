Demez-HL2-ASW-Port

This is a port of Half-Life 2 and the Episodes over to the Newer Alien Swarm Engine.
I used Enhanced Source as a base for this, which you can find here: https://github.com/Enhanced-Source-Project/Enhanced-Source

Now, this repo will be big, but thats becasue due to the way content mounting works in the Alien Swarm Engine,
I have to include files instead of just mounting them.
